## 🔍 Manual Review Before Deploy

1. **Search for personal info:**
   ```bash
   grep -r "your-email@" .
   grep -r "your-phone" .
   grep -r "your-address" .
   ```

2. **Check for API keys:**
   ```bash
   grep -r "api_key" .
   grep -r "secret" .
   grep -r "password.*=" .
   ```

3. **Verify no backend files:**
   ```bash
   ls *.php *.py *.rb *.java
   # Should return "No such file"
   ```
